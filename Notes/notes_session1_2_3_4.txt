Session1 Notes:

Data science: collecting unstructured data -> make it structured -> apply useful algorithms -> get insight of it

AI	-> ML (limited amount of data)
	-> Deep Learning (huge amount of data -> Big Data)

Programming languages in Data Science: R, Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Searborn)
Tableau / Power BI -> to show the insights, back-up presentations tool. Replace pptx and excel

Python is better to use for Data Science because it has a lot of external libraries. Other programming languages doesnâ€™t have enough libraries

Python can be used in: web development, back-end development, site-design UI/UX, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision.

TensorFlow -> Framework -> Google
PyTorch -> Framework -> Meta / Facebook

Google Data Studio -> Similar to Power BI

SQL (structured query language) -> language to manage the data in a management system

Tableau -> similar to PowerBI

***

 How the class will run?
1. Recap
2. Start the topic -> Agenda and the Goal of the session
3. The concepts should be clear from the class
4. Assignment to solve

***
Data Analyst -> analyse the data (Ms Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, Google DataStudio, sql).
Business Analyst -> speak with client (No IT)
Data Scientist -> tools
	-> Jr. Data Scientist 
	-> Decision Scientist
	-> ML Engineer
	-> Big Data Engineer

->  We need the Knowledge and we need the certificates (the proof)

***

How do we learn ML Algorithms?

Maths + Python  -> Data Science  (ML Algorithms) 	
Ex: Linear Regression 
	1. Theory -> why do we need it?
	2. Maths -> drive all the equations
	3. Coding (hands on, follow a pipeline)
	4. Exercise

Programming language: bridge that convert human (high level) language to computer (low level - format 0 and 1) language


ML (branch of computer science)
1. Supervised
2. UnSupervised
3. Reinforcement

***************

Session2 Notes:

Goal / Agenda
1. Introduction to programming 
2. Python programming 
3. Software requirements
4. Anaconda & Google Colab

What is a programming language? = bridge between high level language and low level language

Language translator:
1. Compiler -> compiles the complete code at once: C, C++
2. Interpreter -> it executes the code line by line: Python

Compiler is faster than interpreter
***
Software requirements:
Python: 
	-> Software development
	-> Data Science

Offline tool -> Jupyter Notebook -> Anaconda navigator
Online tool -> Google Collab -> Gmail

***************

Session3 Notes:

Goal / Agenda
1. How to use the tool
2. What is python programming
3. Language translator (compiler, interpreter)
4. How to write in python (variable, data types)

IDE (Integrated Development Environment) = Interactive text editor

Python
	-> general purpose programming language
	-> high level programming language
	-> case sensitive programming language
	-> object oriented programming

Variables & Data types
	Variable = container to store data values
	Data Type = the kind of value we are storing inside variable
	type() = it will state the datatype name

***************

Session4 Notes:

Goal / Agenda
1. Operators in Python (assignment, arithmetic, comparison, logical, membership)
